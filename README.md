RESTful Bookstore API 
This report outlines the testing process for the RESTful Bookstore API I developed as part of my 
Client-Server Architectures coursework. The purpose of this report is to clearly document the 
test cases I designed and executed in order to validate the functionality and robustness of the 
API. The API was built using Java, utilising the JAX-RS framework (Jersey implementation) to 
create RESTful web services. JSON was used throughout for data exchange between client and 
server. To thoroughly test the API endpoints, I used Postman for API development and testing, 
which allowed me to simulate real-world API interactions easily and efficiently.
This report focuses on presenting the test cases in a clear and structured table format, organised 
by each resource class. Both positive and negative test scenarios are included, ensuring that the 
API behaves correctly under normal conditions and handles errors normally when something 
goes wrong.
Building and testing this API has been an enjoyable learning experience, as it allowed me to 
strengthen my understanding of RESTful design principles, exception handling, and the 
importance of thorough testing in software development. This coursework has given an insight 
into real world scenarios, and I have learned new skills which have been really helpful.
